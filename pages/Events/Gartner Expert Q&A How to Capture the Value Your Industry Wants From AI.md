## Health Care
- Focused on research
- Difference between labs / research and production environments
- Very careful approach in AI
### Outcomes
- Increase in productivity using classical AI


## Financial Services
### Race
- 80% of banks will implement AI, 70% will implement genAI
- Ceratain banks combine genAI with other AI. Eg. financial coaching application. Brasil: Ally AI, India: digital relationship manager.

## Government
Difference to other sectors: whole of society!
Government is to steady society, not disrupt

- Existence of new tools does not change prupose

TRISM is major thing in public sector.

**Major challenge: who is accountable?**

## Manufacturing
### Race
- Use cases have reached the peak, nothing in the trough
- Progress in AI is gradual
- Adopting of AI is through embedded AI from vendors
- Data quality concerns preventing to build your own AI
### Outcomes
- Varying
- Some industry sectors are doing better than others
