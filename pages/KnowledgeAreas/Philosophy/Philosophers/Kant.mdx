# Main Ideas

## Categorical Imperitive
The general principle that demands that one respect the humanity in oneself and in others, that one not make an exception for oneself when deliberating about how to act, and in general that one only act in accordance with rules that everyone could and should obey.
Doing the right thing to do for the right reason. Morality has to be pure. 
Good will is at the core of morality.

# Influences from others

## David Hume
Human reason is weaker than we think.
Existence of god cannot be proven.
Human reason is the slave of the passions. It cannot tell us what we ought to do. 


## Rousseau
Influences Kant in moral philosophy: 
- All humans are equal. 
- Weakness of human reason: comparing yourself with others can make you unhappy

Kant says, human reason cannot be the basis of morality, because it is weak, and can make you unhappy, purely by reasoning.

## Newton

# Publications

## Critique of Pure Reason (1781)
Huge, monumental work on theoretical philosophy. Very influential. 
Main question that David Hume put to Kant is discussed in this book: how can we have knowledge of the world?

Relevant thoughts of Kant:
- We cannot prove the existence of God, therefore we cannot base ethics in knowledge of God
- We cannot know that we are free. We cannot know that we are not free. 

# Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals (1785)

Central questions:
- What is moral value?
- What is moral goodness?

## Central idea
Will is at the core of morality. Every human can discern right from wrong. If there is morality it's unconditional. Kant says: the only thing that can be a source of unconditional value is a good will. The intentions of the individual are the only source for morality.
Morality then does not depend on the consequences of actions, nor does it depend on some divine value. Morality has an inward focus: what are the intentions of the individual. A problem arises from this: how can we obtain objective truth / morality from individual subjective intentions?

Kant's reasoning is: it's not enough to do the right thing. It's not enough to have a plan to do the right things. You should also have the right reasons to do the right thing. This reason should be the principle that it's the right thing to do.
