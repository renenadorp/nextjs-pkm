# Chapter 11 - Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence

**Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence (DW/BI)**

DW/BI involves the planning, implementation, and control processes required to provide data for decision support and to support knowledge workers in reporting, querying, and analysis. The goals are to build and maintain the technical environment for integrated data and to enable effective business analysis and decision-making.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Business Intelligence (BI):** Data analysis focused on understanding organizational activities and opportunities to improve success. It also refers to the technologies supporting this analysis, including querying, data mining, and reporting tools.
* **Data Warehouse (DW):** An integrated decision support database combined with software to collect, cleanse, transform, and store data from various sources. It may include data marts, which are subsets of data from the warehouse.
* **Data Warehousing:** The operational processes of extracting, cleansing, transforming, and loading data to maintain the data warehouse.

**Approaches to Data Warehousing:**

* **Inmon's Corporate Information Factory (CIF):** Emphasizes a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and non-volatile collection of data. The data warehouse is organized around major business entities and uses a normalized relational model. Key components include a staging area, ODS (Operational Data Store), data marts, and the data warehouse itself.
* **Kimball's Approach:** Focuses on a dimensional model, structuring data specifically for query and analysis.

**Goals and Principles of Data Warehousing:**

* Support Business Intelligence activity
* Enable effective business analysis and decision-making
* Find ways to innovate based on insights from their data

Guiding principles include focusing on business goals, starting with the end in mind, designing globally but building locally, and promoting transparency and self-service. Metadata is crucial for explaining the data.
