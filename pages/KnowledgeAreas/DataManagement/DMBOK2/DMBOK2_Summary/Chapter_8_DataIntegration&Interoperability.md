# Chapter 8 - Data Integration and Interoperability (DII)

**Overview:**

Data Integration and Interoperability (DII) involves the movement and consolidation of data within and between various data stores, applications, and organizations. It focuses on creating consistent data forms and enabling multiple systems to communicate effectively. DII is crucial for various data management functions like data migration, consolidation, data sharing, and integrating structured and unstructured data.

**Key Dependencies:**

DII relies on several other data management areas, including:

* Data Governance
* Data Architecture
* Data Security
* Metadata Management
* Data Storage and Operations
* Data Modeling and Design

**Business Drivers:**

* Efficient data movement management across numerous databases and stores.
* The need to integrate purchased vendor applications with existing organizational data.
* Managing complexity and costs associated with data integration through enterprise-level design.
* Reducing support costs by standardizing tools and implementations.
* Compliance with data handling standards and regulations.

**Goals and Principles:**

* Making data available in the required format and timeframe.
* Consolidating data into data hubs.
* Lowering solution management costs and complexity.
* Identifying meaningful events and triggering automated actions.
* Supporting Business Intelligence, analytics, Master Data Management, and operational efficiency.
* Taking an enterprise perspective in design while implementing iteratively.
* Balancing local and enterprise data needs.
* Ensuring business accountability for DII design and activities.

**Essential Concepts:**

* **Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL):** The fundamental process of extracting data from a source, transforming it to meet the target system's requirements, and loading it into the target. This can be done in batch or real-time.
* **Extract, Load, and Transform (ELT):** A variation where data is first extracted and loaded into the target system, and then transformed within the target environment.  Common in Big Data environments.
* **Mapping:** The process of developing the lookup matrix from source to target structures, defining data extraction rules, target loading rules, and transformation rules.
* **Latency:** The time difference between data generation in the source system and its availability in the target system.
* **Batch:** Data moves in clumps or files, representing either the full set of data or the changes (delta) since the last transmission.
