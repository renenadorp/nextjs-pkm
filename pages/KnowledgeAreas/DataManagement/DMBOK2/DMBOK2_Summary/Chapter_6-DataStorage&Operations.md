# Chapter 6 - Data Storage and Operations

**Overview:**

This chapter focuses on data storage and operations, which encompass the design, implementation, and support of stored data throughout its lifecycle. It aims to maximize the value of data from creation to disposal. Key aspects include database support (managing the data lifecycle, performance tuning) and database technology support (defining technical requirements, architecture, and issue resolution). Database administrators (DBAs) are central to these activities, playing crucial roles in data operations and security.

**Key Activities:**

* **Manage Database Technology:** Understanding, evaluating, and monitoring database technology.
* **Manage Database Operations:** Understanding requirements, planning for business continuity, developing database instances, managing performance and test datasets, and managing data migration.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Database Terminology:** Defines terms like database, instance, schema, node, and database abstraction.
* **Data Lifecycle Management:** Maintaining data accuracy and consistency through policies and procedures for acquisition, migration, retention, expiration, and disposition.
* **DBA Roles:** Discusses various DBA specializations, including Production DBAs (focused on performance, reliability, backup/recovery), Application DBAs (supporting specific applications), Procedural/Development DBAs (managing stored procedures and development databases), and Network Storage Administrators (NSAs) who focus on the hardware/software supporting data storage arrays.
* **Database Architecture Types:** Explains the difference between centralized (single database) and distributed (multiple databases across multiple systems) databases.

**Goals and Principles:**

* Managing data availability, ensuring data integrity, and managing the performance of data transactions.
* Key principles include: automation, building with reuse in mind, applying best practices, connecting database standards to support requirements, and setting expectations for the DBA role in project work.

**Business Drivers:**

* Business continuity is a primary driver, as organizations rely on their information systems and a reliable data storage infrastructure to minimize disruption.
