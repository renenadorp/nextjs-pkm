# Chapter 3 - Data Governance

* DG is the exercise of authority and control over the management of data assets, ensuring data is managed properly according to policies and best practices.
* A formal DG program helps organizations increase the value they get from their data.

**Key Components of a Data Governance Program:**

* **Strategy:** Defining and driving execution of data strategy.
* **Policy:** Setting and enforcing policies for data management, access, security, and quality.
* **Standards and Quality:** Enforcing data quality and architecture standards.
* **Oversight:** Monitoring and correcting data quality and policy issues (stewardship).
* **Compliance:** Meeting data-related regulatory requirements.
* **Issue Management:** Identifying and resolving data-related issues.
* **Data Management Projects:** Sponsoring efforts to improve data management.
* **Data Asset Valuation:** Setting standards for defining the business value of data assets.

**The Importance of Organizational Change Management:**

* Adopting formal DG requires organizational change management and executive sponsorship.
* Organizations must value data and data management activities to benefit from data as a corporate asset.

**Data Governance and Stewardship:**

* DG involves authority, control, and shared decision-making over data asset management.
* Goals include enabling data management as an asset, defining and implementing data management principles and policies, and monitoring compliance.

**Drivers for Data Governance:**

* Common drivers include regulatory compliance and the rise of advanced analytics and Data Science.
* DG should align with organizational strategy to solve problems and encourage adoption.
* Key drivers focus on reducing risks (general risk management, data security, privacy) and improving processes (regulatory compliance, data quality, metadata management, efficiency in development projects, vendor management).

**Data Governance as an Ongoing Program:**

* DG is not a one-time effort but an ongoing program focused on value and risk reduction.
* It requires a well-understood operating framework that considers organizational and cultural issues.
* DG is separate from IT governance, focusing exclusively on data asset management.

**Goals and Principles of Data Governance:**

* The goal is to enable organizations to manage data as an asset through principles, policies, processes, and oversight.
* DG programs must be sustainable, embedded, and measured.
* Key principles include leadership and strategy, being business-driven, shared responsibility, multi-layered approach, framework-based, and principle-based.

**Essential Concepts:**

* DG ensures data is properly managed without directly executing data management, representing a separation of duty between oversight and execution.
* A data-centric organization values data as an asset and manages it through all lifecycle phases.
