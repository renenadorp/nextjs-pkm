# Chapter 9 - Document and Content Management:

**Document and Content Management Overview**

Document and Content Management focuses on controlling the capture, storage, access, and use of data and information stored outside relational databases, emphasizing the integrity of and access to unstructured or semi-structured information. It shares similarities with data operations management for relational databases but includes strategic drivers due to the direct relationship between unstructured and structured data. Ensuring security and quality requires governance, reliable architecture, and well-managed Metadata.

**Business Drivers \& Goals**

Key business drivers include regulatory compliance, e-discovery readiness, and business continuity. Effective document and content management aims to ensure efficient retrieval and use of unstructured data, integrate structured and unstructured data, and comply with legal and customer expectations.

**Key Principles**

* Everyone in an organization plays a role in protecting the organization's future by appropriately handling records.
* Experts should be involved in policy and planning.
* Organizations should adhere to Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles® (GARP), focusing on accountability, integrity, protection, compliance, availability, retention, disposition, and transparency.

**Essential Concepts**

* **Content:** The data and information within a file, document, or website, managed based on concepts, type, and status, with a defined lifecycle.
* **Content Management:** Processes, techniques, and technologies for organizing, categorizing, and structuring information for storage, publication, and reuse. Enterprise Content Management (ECM) applies these principles across the entire enterprise.
* **Content Metadata:** Essential for managing unstructured data, based on format, search-ability, self-documentation, existing patterns, content subjects, and specific requirements.
* **Content Modeling:** Converting logical content concepts into content types, attributes, and data types with relationships, supporting content strategy and reuse.
* **Content Delivery Methods:** Modular, structured, reusable, and device-independent delivery methods including push, pull, and interactive systems.
* **Controlled Vocabularies:** Defined lists of allowed terms for indexing, categorizing, and retrieving content, aligned with enterprise data models, and managed through defined policies.
