# Chapter 7 - Data Security

**Core Idea:**

Data security involves creating and implementing security policies and procedures to ensure proper authentication, authorization, access, and auditing of data and information assets. The goal is to protect information assets in line with privacy regulations, agreements, and business needs.

**Key Requirements \& Considerations:**

* **Stakeholders:**  Organizations must address the privacy and confidentiality needs of stakeholders (clients, patients, etc.).
* **Regulations:** Compliance with government regulations is crucial.
* **Proprietary Concerns:** Protecting the organization's own data for competitive advantage is vital.
* **Legitimate Access:**  Enabling appropriate access for business processes is necessary.
* **Contractual Obligations:** Adhering to contractual and non-disclosure agreements.

**Goals of Data Security:**

1. Enable appropriate access and prevent inappropriate access to data assets.
2. Comply with privacy, protection, and confidentiality regulations and policies.
3. Enforce and audit stakeholder privacy and confidentiality needs.

**Business Drivers:**

* **Risk Reduction:**  Protecting against regulatory compliance issues, fiduciary responsibility, reputational damage, and legal/moral responsibilities.  This involves classifying sensitive data, locating it, determining protection methods, and understanding its interaction with business processes.
* **Business Growth:**  Trusted e-commerce and robust information security build customer confidence and enable transactions.
* **Security as an Asset:** Using metadata to manage sensitive data, enforce standards, optimize data protection, and build trust with customers and partners.

**Key Principles:**

* **Collaboration:** Requires involvement from IT security, data governance, audit teams, and legal.
* **Enterprise Approach:** Consistent application of standards and policies across the organization.
* **Proactive Management:** Being dynamic and engaging all stakeholders.
* **Clear Accountability:** Clearly defined roles and responsibilities.
* **Metadata-Driven:** Security classification as part of data definitions.
* **Reduce Exposure:** Minimize sensitive data proliferation, especially in non-production environments.

**Essential Concepts:**

* **Vulnerability:** Weaknesses or defects in a system that can be exploited.
* **Threat:** Potential offensive action against an organization (internal or external).
* **Risk:** The possibility of loss, considering probability, damage, effect on revenue, cost to fix, cost to prevent, and attacker intent. Risk prioritization is a formal process.
* **Risk Classifications:** Describe the sensitivity of data and likelihood of potential events.
