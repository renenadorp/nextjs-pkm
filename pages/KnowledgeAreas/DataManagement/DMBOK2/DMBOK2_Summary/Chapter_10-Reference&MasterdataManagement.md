# Chapter 10 - Reference and Master Data Management

**Introduction:**

Chapter 10 of the DMBOK 2 focuses on Reference and Master Data Management. It highlights the importance of consistent data across an organization to reduce costs, risks, and improve overall data quality and business confidence.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Reference Data:** Data used to classify other data or relate it to external information (e.g., code and description tables).
* **Master Data:** Provides context for business activity data, including definitions and identifiers for key business entities (e.g., customers, products). It can be considered an aggregation of Reference Data, enterprise structure data, and transaction structure data.
* **Master Data Management (MDM):** Focuses on controlling Master Data values and identifiers for consistent use across systems, ensuring accuracy and reducing ambiguity. Key challenge is entity resolution.
* **Reference Data Management (RDM):** Focuses on controlling defined domain values and their definitions, ensuring access to complete, accurate, and current values. A key challenge is defining ownership and responsibility for data maintenance.

**Business Drivers:**

* Meeting organizational data requirements
* Managing data quality
* Managing the costs of data integration
* Reducing risk

**Goals:**

* Ensuring complete, consistent, current, and authoritative Master and Reference Data.
* Enabling data sharing across the enterprise.
* Lowering costs and complexity of data usage and integration.

**Principles:**

* Shared Data
* Ownership
* Quality
* Stewardship
* Controlled Change
* Authority

The chapter emphasizes that managing both Reference and Master Data requires a range of data management functions, including Data Governance, Data Quality, and Metadata Management.
