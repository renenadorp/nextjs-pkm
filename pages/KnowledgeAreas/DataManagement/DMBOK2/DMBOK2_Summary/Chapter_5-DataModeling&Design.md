# Chapter 5 - Data Modeling and Design

This chapter introduces data modeling as a critical component of data management. It emphasizes the importance of understanding and documenting data requirements through precise data models.

### Key Concepts:

* **Data Modeling:** The process of discovering, analyzing, and representing data requirements.
* **Data Model:** A precise representation of data requirements, serving as a communication tool and documentation.
* **Types of Data Models:** Relational, Dimensional, Object-Oriented, Fact-Based, Time-Based, and NoSQL.
* **Levels of Detail:** Conceptual, logical, and physical models.
* **Components:** Entities, relationships, facts, keys, and attributes.


### Goals and Principles:

* **Common Vocabulary:** Providing a shared understanding of data.
* **Knowledge Capture:** Documenting explicit knowledge about data and systems.
* **Communication Tool:** Facilitating communication during projects.
* **Foundation for Customization:** Serving as a starting point for application modifications.


### Benefits of Data Modeling:

* Alignment with business requirements.
* Reduced support costs.
* Increased reusability of data.
* Formalization of data structures.
* Clear scope definition.
* Knowledge retention and documentation.


### Types of Data Modeled:

* **Category Information:** Classifying data (e.g., customer types).
* **Resource Information:** Basic profiles of resources (e.g., Customer, Product).
* **Business Event Information:** Data from operational processes (e.g., Customer Orders).
* **Detail Transaction Information:** Detailed data from point-of-sale systems, social media, sensors, etc. (Big Data).


### Data Model Components:

* **Entity:** A thing about which an organization collects information (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How).
* **Entity Aliases:** Entity-type, Entity, and Entity Instance.
